                I am originally from Rutsker, a very small town on Bornholm, we
                moved about a lot so I have lived on most of the rest of the island too.
                When I was ten, I moved to Malaga, Spain with my parents and five siblings.
                Once there I started Spanish primary school and went on to complete secondary
                school too. In the middle of Bachillerato, the Spanish equivalent to College or
                High school, my grandmother died. My grandfather was infirm after my grandmother's
                long-term illness and passing, I had always planned to return to Denmark for university,
                so I quit Bachillerato and moved back to Denmark to continue my studies and take care of my grandfather.

                Upon returning to Denmark I started to look for a line of education that suited me.
                For years I had been building and been interested in the inner workings of computers
                so the EUX program as a Data technician with a speciality in programming, spoke to me.
                I could finish my college diploma and at the same time learn a trade which interested me.

                I am now in my second, almost third, year of my studies and I am
                enjoying it, gone are the notions of learning to code so I could
                make video games and replacing them is the knowledge that not only
                can I make computer games, but also anything else that I put my mind to.
                I have worked with databases, object-oriented languages, Client-side
                web applications, servers and much more.
            </p>

            <p>
                I do not know what is going to happen in the future but what I do
                know, is that once I complete my diploma as a Data Technician, I
                want to specialize, I cannot say in what yet but I do know that I want to continue learning.
